 <h2>1945</h2>
 Vannevar Bush writes <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">an article</a> in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/world/"> Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche
<br><br>
<h2>1960s</h2>
Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the  <a href="http://www.bootstrap.org/library.htm">Bootstrap Institute library.</a>
<br><br>
Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate. 20th National Conference, New York,<a href="https://www.acm.org/"> Association for Computing Machinery</a>, 1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link.

<br> <br>Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.

<h2>1980</h2>
While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1980/Enquire/scaled/">Enquire user manual as scanned images </a>or as <a href="http://infomesh.net/2001/enquire/manual/"> HTML page(alt)</a>.
