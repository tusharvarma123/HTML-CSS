          <b>Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a South African former international cricketer, 
            and a current commentator. AB de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times during 
            his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.[2]
             He is regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the sport and as the best batsman of his era.[3][4] 
             de Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. 
             He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Regarded as one of the
              most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, de Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly
               behind the wicket-keeper.[5] He made his international debut in a Test match against England in 2004 and first played a One Day
                International (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test 
                and ODI cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.[6]
                 In limited overs cricket, he is an attacking player.[7] He holds the record for the fastest ODI fifty(16 balls), fastest ODI
                  century(31 balls), and fastest ODI 150(62 balls).</b>
