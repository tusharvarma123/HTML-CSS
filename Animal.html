        <i>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat with a tawny to creamy white or pale
           buff fur that is marked with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Its head is small and rounded, with a 
           short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the
            head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg 
            (46 and 159 lb). It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 
          to 98 km/h (50 to 61 mph); it has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a 
          light build, long thin legs and a long tail.</i>

        The cheetah was first described in the late 18th century. Four subspecies are recognised today that are
         native to Africa and central Iran. An African subspecies was introduced to India in 2022. It is now distributed
          mainly in small, fragmented populations in northwestern, eastern and southern Africa and central
         Iran. It lives in a variety of habitats such as savannahs in the Serengeti, arid mountain ranges in the Sahara and hilly desert terrain.
